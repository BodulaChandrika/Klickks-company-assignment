Assignment: Login & Logout Flow in React.js 
Implement Login & Logout Flow in React.js and Node.js
Description: Create a simple login and logout system in a React.js and Node.js application using a database (SQLite). The flow should allow a user to: Register (sign up) with email and password. Log in using the registered credentials. Stay logged in using session/cookie-based authentication. Log out and clear the session.
Requirements:
Use React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend API routes.
Store user data (email, password) in a database.
Securely hash passwords before saving (e.g., using bcrypt).
Add basic validation (e.g., don’t allow duplicate email during registration).
Push the completed code to a new GitHub repository.
Write a short README explaining how to set up and run the project.
